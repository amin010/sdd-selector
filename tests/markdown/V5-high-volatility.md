## Runner-up
GSD Core — Acceptability 12% vs 50% for OpenSpec.

## Practice overlays
### Delta-only specs (included in base) — 68% inclusion
Source: OpenSpec
Write specs only for the change at hand. Strongest brownfield fit in the catalogue.
Enforcement: Advisory — /opsx:verify (expanded profile) (Does not block archiving.)
Human gate — Delta specs ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED (Human archives.)
Triggered by: derived view

### Low-ceremony fast path (included in base) — 62% inclusion
Source: OpenSpec
A documented two-track policy beside any heavyweight pipeline.
Enforcement: Advisory — /opsx:verify (expanded profile) (Does not block archiving.)
Human gate — Delta specs ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED (Human archives.)
Triggered by: derived view

### Change archive (included in base) — 47% inclusion
Source: OpenSpec
Archived change folders are an audit artifact, but /opsx:verify does not block archive.
Enforcement: Advisory — /opsx:verify (expanded profile) (Does not block archiving.)
Human gate — Delta specs ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED (Human archives.)
